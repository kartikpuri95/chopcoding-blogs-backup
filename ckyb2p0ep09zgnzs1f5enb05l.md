## Top 5 resources to start your web3 journey

Web 3 is the new sensation in town, here is my best pick to learn solidity and start your journey as a web 3 developer.

## 1. Buildspace

This site is my favorite place to learn solidity, these guys organize weekly cohorts where you can interact with other developers and build some challenging stuff. It's a must-visit if you are planning to start your journey in web3.
